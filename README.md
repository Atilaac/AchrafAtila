**About me:** 
I am Dr.- Achraf Atila, I studied physics at the University of Hassan II in Casablanca, from which I obtained his Bachelor of Science in physics and applications in 2015 and Master of Science in physics and new technologies in 2017. After finishing his M.Sc, I moved to Germany and started a Ph.D. in the group of Prof. Dr.-ing. Erik Bitzek at the Institute I: General Materials Properties, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, FAU in Erlangen. Starting from July 2022 I joined the group of Prof. Dr. Martin Müser as a postdoctoral research associate working on atomistic simulations of different inorganic materials. From July 2021 till December 2022, I held a guest scientist position at Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung GmbH in Düsseldorf, Germany.
I am a computational material scientist, focusing on amorphous materials, with a strong interest in the relationship between composition, mechanical, and other physical properties. His research mostly focuses on the mechanical behavior and deformation mechanisms in oxide glasses.


**Research interests:** My research interests lie at the intersection of materials science, and physics. Generaly, I am interested in using atomistic simulations and data analysis tools to study and understand materials behavior under different conditions.
